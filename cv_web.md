## About me
<p style="text-align:justify">
    Ever since I was a child, I have been always interested in programming. When I was 15, I started making games for fun in Unity/C#, and contiued to do so to this day.
    When I finally started to learn how to program properly in university, I realized that this is my passion. So I'm excited to finally try myself out in a professional setting and work with like-minded people.
